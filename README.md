# PSFSim

Repository for simulations for testing point spread function measurements for the Roman Space Telescope. In development. 

Added features include position dependent pupil mask, detector effects, Zernike path differences, and more!

Most code lives in PSFObject.py, but it may also be useful to look at opticsPSF.py and filter_detector_properties.py
